## ⚡ Quickstart

Follow these steps to build and run DeFi agents:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) with Docker Compose v2.24 or greater installed on your system.

> [!TIP]
> If you are on an M-series Mac, you need to install Docker using the [dmg package](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/) supplied officially by Docker rather than through Homebrew or other means to avoid build issues.

### Get the Code

To get started, clone the repository through command line or your preferred IDE:

```
git clone https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit.git &&
cd arbitrum-vibekit
```

### Run DeFi Agents

The swapping and lending agents start automatically when you launch the Vibekit frontend. Follow the steps below to get everything up and running.

#### Configure Environment Variables

Navigate to the [typescript](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript) directory and create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` and filling in the required values:

```bash
cd typescript &&
cp .env.example .env
```

At a minimum, you need:

- Your preferred AI provider API key (e.g., `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Generate a secure `AUTH_SECRET` (you can use https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 or `openssl rand -base64 32`)

#### Start Services:

```bash
# Start the web frontend and default agents
docker compose up
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you previously ran `docker compose up` with an older version of Vibekit and encounter frontend or database-related errors, clear your browser cache and run the following command in your terminal:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose down && docker volume rm typescript_db_data && docker compose build web --no-cache && docker compose up
> ```

#### Access the Web Interface:

Once all services are running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. To be able to chat with the agents, you need to connect your wallet first. Click on "Connect Wallet" to get started:

## 🔧 Build Your Own Agent

To build your own agent, we recommend using our [Quickstart Agent template](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript/templates/quickstart-agent). It provides all the necessary boilerplate code so you can start building right away. Follow these steps to integrate and run the Quickstart Agent:

### Enable the Quickstart Agent in the Frontend

In the [agents-config.ts](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/blob/main/typescript/clients/web/agents-config.ts) file, uncomment the agent's configuration in two places:

```typescript
...
  {
    id: 'quickstart-agent-template' as const,
    name: 'Quickstart',
    description: 'Quickstart agent',
    suggestedActions: [],
  },
...
```

```typescript
...
  ['quickstart-agent-template', 'http://quickstart-agent-template:3007/sse'],
...
```

### Add the Agent to Docker Compose

In the [docker compose](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/blob/main/typescript/compose.yml) file, uncomment the service definition for the Quickstart Agent:

```yaml
---
quickstart-agent-template:
  build:
    context: ./
    dockerfile: templates/quickstart-agent/Dockerfile
  container_name: vibekit-quickstart-agent-template
  env_file:
    - path: .env
      required: true
    - path: templates/quickstart-agent/.env
      required: false
  ports:
    - 3007:3007
  restart: unless-stopped
```

### Configure the Agent's Environment

Navigate to the agent's directory and create a local `.env` by copying the`.env.example` file. Make sure to populate the `.env` file with your API keys and configurations:

```bash
cd typescript/templates/quickstart-agent && cp .env.example .env
```

### Rebuild and Restart Services

Navigate to the [typescript](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript) directory, rebuild the web application and restart all services to apply the changes:

```bash
cd ../.. &&
docker compose build web --no-cache && docker compose up
```

The Quickstart Agent is now accessible through the web frontend:

## 🔗 ERC-8004 Agent Registration

Vibekit now supports [ERC-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) agent registration, enabling on-chain identity and discovery for your AI agents.

### What is ERC-8004?

ERC-8004 is an Ethereum standard for registering AI agents on-chain, providing:
- **Canonical Identity**: A primary chain where your agent's identity is registered
- **Multi-Chain Discovery**: Mirror registrations for broad ecosystem reach
- **Trust Frameworks**: Verifiable agent capabilities and certifications
- **IPFS Metadata**: Decentralized storage for agent metadata

### Getting Started with ERC-8004

The agent-node framework includes built-in ERC-8004 support through the config-driven workspace:

#### 1. Initialize with ERC-8004 Support

When creating a new agent, the interactive `agent init` wizard guides you through ERC-8004 configuration:

```bash
cd typescript/lib/agent-node
npx -y @emberai/agent-node init
```

The wizard will prompt you to:
- Enable ERC-8004 registration (default: yes)
- Select canonical chain (default: Arbitrum One)
- Choose mirror chains (default: Ethereum + Base)
- Optionally provide operator address for CAIP-10

#### 2. Configure in agent.md

Your `config/agent.md` includes an `erc8004` frontmatter block:

```yaml
erc8004:
  enabled: true
  canonical:
    chainId: 42161  # Arbitrum One
    operatorAddress: '0x...'  # Optional, for CAIP-10
  mirrors:
    - { chainId: 1 }      # Ethereum
    - { chainId: 8453 }   # Base
  identityRegistries:
    '42161': '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'  # Registry addresses
    # ... other chains
```

#### 3. Register Your Agent On-Chain

```bash
# Register on canonical chain and mirrors (default)
npx -y @emberai/agent-node register --from-config

# Register on a specific chain only
npx -y @emberai/agent-node register --from-config --chain 42161
```

The command will:
1. Upload agent metadata to IPFS via Pinata
2. Open a browser for transaction signing
3. Automatically persist `agentId` and `registrationUri` to config

#### 4. Update Registration

```bash
# Update all registered chains
npx -y @emberai/agent-node update-registry --from-config

# Update a specific chain
npx -y @emberai/agent-node update-registry --from-config --chain 42161

# Use CLI overrides (will prompt to persist)
npx -y @emberai/agent-node update-registry --from-config --version 2.0.0
```

### Agent Card Extension

When ERC-8004 is enabled, your Agent Card automatically includes an extension for discovery:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "extensions": [
      {
        "uri": "https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004",
        "description": "ERC-8004 discovery/trust",
        "required": false,
        "params": {
          "canonicalCaip10": "eip155:42161:0x...",
          "identityRegistry": "eip155:42161:0x...",
          "registrationUri": "ipfs://Qm...",
          "supportedTrust": [...]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Validate Configuration

Use the `doctor` command to validate your ERC-8004 configuration:

```bash
npx -y @emberai/agent-node doctor
```

This checks for:
- Valid chain IDs and registry addresses
- Missing operator address (warns if CAIP-10 cannot be formed)
- Zero-address registry placeholders
- Correct extension composition

## 🤖 LLM Guides

### `.rulesync` Configuration

The `.rulesync` directory serves as the source of truth for all LLM configuration files. This system allows you to manage rules, commands, and subagents in a centralized location and automatically generate them for different AI tools:

```
.rulesync/
├── commands/           # High-level command structures
├── subagents/          # Persona-driven specialized agents
└── rules/              # Workspace-wide guidelines and best practices
```

Key Benefits:

- **Single Source of Truth**: All LLM configurations managed in one place
- **Automatic Generation**: Run `pnpm sync:rules` to generate files for Claude, Cursor, and other tools
- **Version Control**: Track changes to AI configurations alongside code changes
- **Consistency**: Ensure all AI tools follow the same guidelines and workflows

To generate all LLM configuration files, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm sync:rules

# Files are automatically generated to:
# - .claude/ (for Claude Code)
# - .cursor/ (for Cursor IDE)
```

### Claude

For Claude models, prompt engineering is handled through a set of dedicated files in the [`.claude/`](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/.claude) directory. These files include detailed instructions, examples, and best practices to guide LLMs in generating accurate and efficient code:

- **agents/**: Contains prompts for persona-driven agents that specialize in tasks like Test-Driven Development, documentation, and feature writing.
- **commands/**: Includes prompts that define high-level command structures for planning, execution, and version control.
- **hooks/**: Provides scripts that can be triggered at different stages of the development lifecycle, such as pre-task and post-task actions.

Additionally, [`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) provides comprehensive guidance for Claude Code when working with the Vibekit codebase, including architecture overview, development standards, and code quality guidelines.

### Cursor

Cursor rules files are located in the [`.cursor/rules`](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/.cursor/rules) directory. These files define best practices, workflows, and workspace conventions for building and maintaining agents:

- **createVibekitAgent.mdc**: A guide for creating and configuring new agents, including best practices, required dependencies, and setup instructions.

- **vibeCodingWorkflow.mdc**: Outlines the step-by-step development workflow for agents, including the Planner/Executor roles, task breakdowns, and conventions for collaborative development.

- **workspaceRules.mdc**: Documents workspace-wide guidelines and best practices for the monorepo, such as dependency management, development scripts, and CI/CD standards.
