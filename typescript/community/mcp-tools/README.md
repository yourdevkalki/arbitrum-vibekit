## Community MCP Tools

Welcome to Vibekit's MCP tools directory! Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools are standardized interfaces that allow agents to easily interact with on-chain data, execute DeFi operations, and integrate with external services. This directory contains the MCP building blocks that provide DeFi agents with sophisticated functionality.

## Build Your MCP Tool

By contributing new MCP tools, you expand the capabilities available to all Vibekit agents. Your tools can enable new DeFi strategies or enhance existing functionality.

To showcase your MCP tool, consider building a demo agent in the [community](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript/community) directory. A working example demonstrates your tool's functionality and helps others understand how to integrate it into their projects.

We're excited to see what you build! Join our [Telegram chat](https://t.me/EmberChat) for updates and support.
