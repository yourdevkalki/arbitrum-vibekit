## Introduction

This directory provides a reference implementation of a Pendle agent using Arbitrum Vibekit and Ember AI's MCP server. It demonstrates how to set up a server, define agent functionalities, and process swapping operations via MCP tools. You can expand or modify this template by adding new tools or incorporating additional MCP-compatible functionalities to suit your project's requirements.

## Example Capabilities

Below are some example user inputs that showcase the swapping agent's capabilities:

- `Swap 0.00001 wstETH to wstETH_YT via wstETH market on arbitrum one`

- `Swap 0.1 wstETH_YT to wstETH on arbitrum one`

## Run Agent

To run and interact with the agent, follow the instructions in the [`examples/README.md`](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/blob/main/typescript/examples/README.md) file.
