# Monorepo Workspace Guidelines

Rules and best practices that apply to the entire pnpm workspace monorepo.

## PNPM Workspace Setup

- Bootstrap all dependencies: run `pnpm install` at the `typescript/` directory of the repo.
- Build all packages: run `pnpm build` at root (executes each package's TypeScript compiler).

## Running in Development

- Prefer `tsx` for ESM TypeScript entrypoints:
  - Install as a dev dependency at root: `pnpm add -Dw tsx`
  - In each package's `package.json`, configure:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "tsx src/index.ts"
    }
    ```
- To start a single package in dev mode: `pnpm dev -F <package-name>`.

## Module Resolution & Transpilation

- Use `NodeNext` module resolution and ES2022 target in all `tsconfig.json` files.
- Avoid using `ts-node` without `--esm`; rely on `tsx` for local ESM TypeScript execution.

## CI/CD & Non-interactive Flags

- Use non-interactive flags for automation (e.g., `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm test -- --ci`).
- Always run scripts via `pnpm run <script>` to ensure consistency.

## Version Control & Force Flags

- Do not use any `--force` flags (e.g., `git push --force`, `pnpm install --force`) without explicit approval.

## Dependency Management with pnpm Catalogs

- Shared dependency versions are managed through pnpm catalogs defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- To use a catalog dependency in a package, specify `"catalog:"` as the version (e.g., `"zod": "catalog:"`).
- To add a new shared dependency to the catalog:
  1. Add it to the `catalog:` section in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with a specific version
  2. Use `"catalog:"` in any package that needs this dependency
- Benefits: explicit opt-in per package, transparent version management, easy updates.

## General Best Practices

- Maintain consistent dependency versions across packages using pnpm catalogs defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- Use pnpm filters (`-r`, `-F`) or `pnpm recursive` for efficient cross-package commands.
- Document any new workspace-level tool or script additions in this file.
- Never add depenencies directly to `package.json` files. Instead use `pnpm add` or `pnpm add -D` commands to add new dependencies. This ensures you have the latest versions.
- Do not add trivial assertions like this:
  > expect(response).to.exist;
- Prefer deep equality checks in assertion tests to multiple shallow equality checks (`expect(sth).to.deep.equal...`)
- Do not wrap blocks of code in try/catch only to add context to the error. simply propagate errors.
- To lint the code, run `pnpm recursive run lint` in the `typescript/` folder.
- Never use .passthrough() with zod schemas.
- ALWAYS use pnpm
- never use NPM
- this project is a multi-package PNPM workspace with root in `./typescript/`
- NEVER use relative file imports to import a package within the workspace
- NEVER use `file:/` in package.json to refer to a package within the workspace - use `workspace:*` instead
- Do not add trivial comments that simply state the meaning of next line. Only add comments that convey non-trivial information.
- Never redefine existing interfaces. always import and reuse
- NEVER produce mocks instead of real implementations
- If you encounter a problem related to missing environment variables, do not try to mock them - simply stop and prompt the user to fill them.
- Never create value or type aliases for compatibility - don't hesitate to update the call sites to use 'true' names.
- When refactorings are done, update the import paths rather than maintaining compatibility with aliases
