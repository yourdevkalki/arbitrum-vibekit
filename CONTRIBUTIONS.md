## Contributing to Vibekit

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Vibekit! This guide explains how to make valuable contributions to the project.

## Getting Started

Before you start your work, checkout [open issues](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/issues) to see if someone is already working on the same topic. For any changes or new features, create an issue first to avoid duplicate work.

> [!NOTE]  
> Duplicate contributions will not get integrated or rewarded.

## Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions, all of which follow the same development workflow outlined below:

### 🐛 Bug Reports and Documentation Fixes

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Check [open issues](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported.

2. **Create a Detailed Report**: If not found, create a new issue for the [bug report](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) or the [documentation update](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/issues/new?template=documentation.yml).

3. **Wait For Your Issue To Be Approved By The Team**: A team member will comment on your issue to let you know it is approved for contribution.

4. **Contribute Your Fix**: Follow the [development workflow](#development-workflow) below to implement and submit your fix. Make sure to reference the issue number in your PR.

### 🔌 Expanding Protocol Support

Vibekit supports DeFi protocol integrations through the Ember Plugin System.

> [!NOTE]  
> All protocol support and on-chain executions must be implemented through the [Ember Plugin System](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript/onchain-actions-plugins). Contributions that bypass this step will not be integrated or rewarded.

1. **Create an Issue**: Navigate to the [issue board](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/issues) to [create a new issue](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/issues/new?template=protocol_integration.yml) detailing the protocol you intend to integrate. Make sure that a similar issue is not already created by someone else.

2. **Review Plugin Documentation**: Check the comprehensive [Ember Plugin System documentation](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript/onchain-actions-plugins/README.md) for detailed implementation guidelines, architecture overview, and code examples.

3. **Wait For Your Issue To Be Approved By The Team**: A team member will comment on your issue to let you know it is approved for contribution.

4. **Submit Your Contribution**: Follow the [development workflow](#development-workflow) below to implement your protocol integration. Make sure to reference the issue number in your PR.

### 🚀 Adding New Functionality

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Check [open issues](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/issues) to make sure no one else is working on a similar feature.

2. **Create a Detailed Issue**: Create a detailed issue explaining your new [MCP tools](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/issues/new?template=mcp_server.yml), [agent template](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/issues/new?template=agent_template.yml), [UI improvement](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/issues/new?template=ui_improvement.yml) or [framework feature](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).

3. **Study Existing Patterns**: Review existing implementations and templates for reference.

4. **Wait For Your Issue To Be Approved By The Team**: A team member will comment on your issue to let you know it is approved for contribution.

5. **Submit Your Contribution**: Follow the [development workflow](#development-workflow) below to implement your new functionality. Make sure to reference the issue number in your PR.

## Development Workflow

> [!NOTE]
